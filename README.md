# HR-Dashboard
This is an end-to-end project and implementation of Power BI

Objective:- Help an organization to improve employee performance and improve employee retention (reduce attrition) by creating an HR Analytics dashboard.

# I worked on this project 
* Data Collecting
* Data Importing
* Data Cleaning & Processing
* Data Modeling 
* Data Analysis & Visualization
* Dashboard Creation
* Final Insights

# Data Cleaning & Processing 
After collecting CSV files and importing them into PowerBI performed various activities in Power Query Editor, removing duplicates, removing missing values, removing unimportant columns, adding new columns for need (Using Dax query) and transforming the data into a format that can be easily analyzed.

# Data Modeling 
The data modelling process was undertaken to create a logical structure for the data, enabling it to be 
analyzed and visualized effectively. 

# Data Analysis & Visualization 
* Tree Map chart: Unleash the attrition distribution by gender, painting a vivid picture of the hidden patterns within your workforce.

* Donut chart: Sink your teeth into attrition count by education field, unearthing trends that will reshape your talent strategies.

* Stacked column chart: Explore the attrition count by age group, revealing the key to retaining different generations in your organization.

* Matrix table: Delve into job roles and their satisfaction scores, unlocking the secret to content and engaged workforce.

* Stacked bar chart: Dissect attrition count by monthly salary slabs, guiding your decisions on compensation and retention like never before.

* Area chart: Unveil attrition count based on years in the company, pinpointing critical retention periods and prompting strategic interventions.

* Stacked bar chart: Identify the top 4 job roles with the highest attrition count, empowering you to focus on the areas that need immediate attention.

* Filters: Supercharge your experience with dynamic department filters, enabling seamless exploration across the entire dashboard. Your data, your way!

# Dashboard Creation 
Identify the KPIs, design an intuitive and visually appealing dashboard, and have interactive visualization and filtering capability 
to allow users to explore the data at various levels of granularity.

# Final Insights 
* Maximum attrition happening in the age group of 26 to 35.
* Maximum attrition happens in Life Sciences Education i.e. 38% and Laboratory Technician as job role.
* Attrition is directly proportional to job satisfaction as well for different job roles. Hence lower the number, the more chance of attrition.
* Maximum attrition observed in employees having 1 to 2 years in the company.
* Also average salary is 6.5k, yet employees earning below that slab have higher chances of attrition.

Based on this, I've tried to create an interactive dashboard.
